# Trajectory-Visualization
Creation of trajectory geometries (polylines) from GPS points. Export in shapefile (.shp) or .html (with Folium)

In track_test.csv some gps points are saved. Each point has a trip identifier (or trajectory identifier)

The 2 python scripts take as input the input file, read the gps points and create trajectories that are saved either in shapefile or htlm file. 

The html file can be directly viewed from a browser. 

The shapefile can be loaded in GIS such as tha open source QGIS.
